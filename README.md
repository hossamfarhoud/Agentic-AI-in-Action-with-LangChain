🔹 Agentic AI in Action with LangChain 🔹

Most LLMs are static — they answer based only on past training data. That means if you ask:
👉 “Who is the current president of the U.S.?” or “Who won IPL 2025?”
…a plain LLM might give outdated or even hallucinated answers. 🚧

That’s where Agentic AI comes in. Instead of just predicting the next token, an AI Agent can:
1️⃣ Plan – break down the task into steps.
2️⃣ Call Tools – like Tavily Search for live information.
3️⃣ Reason & Decide – combine retrieved data with its own logic.
4️⃣ Answer with Evidence – grounded in real sources.

📌 In my notebook, I showed:

LLM Limitation → Wrong/static answers from the base model.

Agent + Tavily Search → Correct, live answers (current president + IPL 2025 winner).

Agentic RAG → Integrated Microsoft’s financial transcript into a retriever, then wrapped it as a tool to let the agent answer domain-specific Qs.

Extended Tools → Even added Yahoo Finance news for real-time market updates.

⚡ Takeaway:
Agentic AI transforms LLMs from passive text generators into active problem solvers that can plan, search, retrieve, and validate.

This is how we go from hallucinations ➝ grounded intelligence.
